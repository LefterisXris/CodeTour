# CodeTour

MSc Thesis. University of Macedonia, Greece.

**Original Name**: CodeTrailer
> :exclamation: Renamed to CodeTour as a similar VSCode `GREAT` plugin already exist (https://github.com/microsoft/codetour), and thus this one would be compatible with it and would try to provide more enhanced experience.

### Thesis tile: `Code Reading Challenges & Best Practices`

Master Thesis, MSc Program: *Computer Science and Technology*, [University of Macedonia]()

#### Thesis Goals

1. to find out, what makes Code reading so challenging, especially when there is no one for direct assistance,
2. to identify some Best Practices that may improve Code reading and understanding process,
3. to provide a tool, which could be standing as a Virtual guide for a developer, providing navigation and demonstration
   of important code parts, as instructed/recorded by a Project member.

The whole Thesis (including research and development) is being managed on Github, and more information can be found on
the repository: https://github.com/LefterisXris/CodeTour. The final results would be announced on the repo, so keep an
eye on that, in case you are interested to check them.

### Management

The following projects have been created for managing the whole Thesis (including research and development):

- [Thesis Deliverables](https://github.com/LefterisXris/CodeTour/projects/3)
- [Research](https://github.com/LefterisXris/CodeTour/projects/2)
- [Plugin - Development](https://github.com/LefterisXris/CodeTour/projects/1)

### üì¢ Participate on the research, via the Thesis survey (SurveySparrow): [Code Reading Challenges & Best Practices](https://codetour.surveysparrow.com/s/code-reading-challenges--best-practices/tt-080a698c44)

## :wrench: Plugin Info :electric_plug:

![Build](https://github.com/LefterisXris/CodeTrailer/workflows/Build/badge.svg)
[![Version](https://img.shields.io/jetbrains/plugin/v/PLUGIN_ID.svg)](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/PLUGIN_ID)
[![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/jetbrains/plugin/d/PLUGIN_ID.svg)](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/PLUGIN_ID)

## Vision

üëâ Vision: A tool that stands as a Virtual guide for a new member able to navigate him throughout the code,
demonstrating important code parts or features, based on the instructions (configuration) that an experienced project
member has already provided. Think of it, like a tutorial-wizard that presents the code with extra info, comments,
images and maybe voice as well. Adding instructions is as simple as adding a new breakpoint, and the tool is able to
auto-adjust, so that on code changes, the instructions (steps) remain valid. Instructions can also be under version
control, for maintainability.

<!-- Plugin description -->
[CodeTour](https://github.com/LefterisXris/CodeTour) is an Intellij plugin, which allows you to record and play back
guided walkthroughs of your codebases. It's like a table of contents, that can make it easier to onboard (or re-board!)
to a new project/feature area, visualize bug reports, or understand the context of a code review/PR change. A **Code
Tour** is simply a series of interactive **Steps**, each of which are associated with a specific file/line, and include
a description of the respective code. This allows developers to clone a repo, and then immediately start learning it,
without needing to refer to rely on help from others. Tours can be version controlled into a repo, to enable sharing
with other contributors.

To use the Code Tour tool window, select <kbd>View</kbd> > <kbd>Tool Windows</kbd> > <kbd>Tours Navigation</kbd>.

Features:

- Create new Tours and Steps easily through Editor's Gutter context menu (similar to adding breakpoints) <kbd>Right
  Click on gutter</kbd> > <kbd>Add Tour Step</kbd>
- HTML support for Step's description (markdown support soon)
- Customizable (location, size, font etc) popup window for Step's description
- Tree-like view of Tours and their Steps on a ToolPane
- Code Navigation with single click (on Steps available on Tours Tree)
- Shortcuts for Navigating on Previous (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd>) and Next (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>
  Alt</kbd>+<kbd>W</kbd>) Steps

Ideal for:

- Code Reviews *-- e.g. Walkthrough the context of a Pull Request*
- Feature documentation *-- e.g. How a feature's workflow is depicted on the code*
- Visualize bugs *-- e.g. follow a scenario that led to an error/bug/issue*
- Onboard or re-board to a project *-- Start learning the project through the interactive Tour Steps, without relying on
  help from others*

Feel free to **suggest** features, **request** changes and **report** issues on CodeTour
repo https://github.com/LefterisXris/CodeTour/discussions
